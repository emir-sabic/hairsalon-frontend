## Technical Requirements

The hair salon website is developed using the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: [Insert Backend Framework/Language]
- Database: [Insert Database System]

The specific backend framework/language and database system will depend on the developer's preference and requirements.

## Out of Scope

The following functionalities are currently out of scope for the hair salon website:

1. **Admin Panel**: An admin panel for managing the website's configurations, settings, and content is not included in the current scope. This functionality allows administrators to oversee the platform, handle business-related issues, and maintain the quality of the website.

2. **Responsive UI Design**: The website's UI design is not responsive, meaning it may not adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions. As a result, the user experience on smaller screens may not be optimal.

3. **Filtering Jobs**: The website does not

 include a filtering option for job applications from specific users. For example, the salon cannot limit job applications to only users with specific skills or qualifications.

4. **Integrated Chat**: Communication between the salon and users after a candidate is selected is not facilitated within the website. Instead, users' email addresses will be visible, allowing communication via email. As a result, an integrated chat feature within the website is not available.

Please note that these features may be considered for future development or customization based on specific requirements and priorities.
